# GraphQL App Best Practices

This repo is a practice space for experimenting with Apollo Client (using React), Apollo GraphQL Server, along with performance, unit tests, and CI build process.

## Organization

The browser bundle server is located in `client/` and the GraphQL server is in `server/`. These are separate NPM repos.
